### Installation

#### From Crates.io

Start by obtaining Rust from https://rustup.rs. Afterwards, run

```sh
cargo install termimage
```

After the installation process finishes, running `termimage` should produce an error message.
If it does, you're ready to move on to the Usage sexion below.

If, however, you've encountered a problem during the installation, do not hesitate to open an issue [here](https://github.com/nabijaczleweli/termimage/issues/new).

#### From Debian repository

The following line in `/etc/apt/sources.list`:
```apt
deb https://debian.nabijaczleweli.xyz stable main
```

With [my PGP key](https://keybase.io/nabijaczleweli) (the two URLs are interchangeable):
```sh
wget -O- https://debian.nabijaczleweli.xyz/nabijaczleweli.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add
# or
sudo wget -O/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/nabijaczleweli.asc https://keybase.io/nabijaczleweli/pgp_keys.asc
```

Then the usual
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install termimage
```
will work on x86_64 and i686.

See the [repository README](https://debian.nabijaczleweli.xyz/README) for more information.

#### From AUR

There are three AUR packages, [maintained](https://github.com/orhun/PKGBUILDs) by [ohrun](https://github.com/orhun):
  * [`termimage`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/termimage), which builds the latest released version,
  * [`termimage-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/termimage-git), which builds the latest git revision, and
  * [`termimage-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/termimage-git), which downloads the latest official build artifacts.

If you use an [AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers), you should be able to
```sh
yay -S termimage
```

Otherwise, you should be able to clone an individual package repository and compile it with [`makepkg`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg) by running
```sh
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/termimage.git && cd termimage && makepkg -si
```

#### From pre-built executables

Alternatively, have a glance over at the [releases page](https://github.com/nabijaczleweli/termimage/releases), which should host Windows and Linux x86_64 binaries.

Installation should be a matter of downloading them, marking as executable, and copying somewhere to your `$PATH`.

### Usage

Display an image

```sh
termimage IMAGE_PATH
```

Print all images in a dir to a file.

```sh
(for f in $(find image_dir -type f); do termimage -s 150x33 $f; done) > out_file
```

For more usage examples see [the documentation](https://rawcdn.githack.com/nabijaczleweli/termimage/doc/termimage/index.html).
